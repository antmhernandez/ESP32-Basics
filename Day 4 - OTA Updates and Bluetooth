Day 4 – Bluetooth and OTA Updates. 

OTA: The ESP32 board can be encoded “Over the Air” through its Wifi connection. 

The additional OTA Code must be included in EACH sketch that is written to the board. 

The instance OTA Code is not included, the board can no longer receive OTA updates. 

Basic OTA is delivered via the Arduino IDE, over Wifi, to the board. 

Web Updater OTA uses functionality through a web page, served by the ESP32, to add code to the board via Wifi. 

We will use the Web Updater OTA method. The Basic OTA method requires Python 2.7+, a large file, to be installed on your machine. It then uses the Arduino IDE to recognize a ‘ESP32 board port’ for upload. 

Web Updater OTA: 

Download the ESP32 board add-on  

File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs: Add https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json (no quotes) 

Tools -> Board -> Board Manager: Search ESP32 by Espressif 

Access the Webupdater OTA code:  

File -> Examples -> ArduinoOTA -> OTAWebUpdater 

Open the file. Change the SSID and PASSWORD values to your Network’s. 

(YES! Arduino comes jam-packed with example code of various kinds!!) 

Upload the code 

Visit the IP address shown 

“admin” and “admin” for username and password 

Download the “OTA-WebUpdate-and-Blink" sketch to a New Arduino project file. 

Change the SSID and Password 

Sketch -> Export Compiled Binary 

This .bin file lives in the Arduino -> [Project Name] folder 

You will upload the .bin file to the web interface for the ESP32 

DO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE OTA CODE. Embed additional code within it.

Bluetooth! Host Mode: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-bluetooth-classic-arduino-ide/ 

Bluetooth = short-range wireless technology standard for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances (~33 ft) and for building personal area networks (PAN).  

BLE = Bluetooth Low Energy =  

Unlike Bluetooth which is always on, BLE remains in sleep mode constantly except for when a connection is initiated. This makes it consume very low power. BLE consumes approximately 1/100th  as much power as Bluetooth (depending on the use case). 

Additionally, BLE supports not only point-to-point communication, but also broadcast mode, and mesh network. Due to its properties, BLE is suitable for applications that need to exchange small amounts of data periodically running on a coin cell

Applications of BLE: Fitness Tracker (send small amounts of data), Indoor Positioning (GPS positioning module),  

Load Bluetooth code in Arduino IDE:  

File -> Examples -> Examples for ESP32: BluetoothSerial: SerialToSerialBT 

Load a Bluetooth to Serial app onto a phone or pad. 

nRF Connect for Mobile from Nordic, it works on Android (Google Play Store) and iOS (App Store). 

Enable your bluetooth adaptor on the device which will connect 

Download Bluetooth Terminal for ios. 

Navigate to Characteristic and send an ASCII message. 

 

Bluetooth may “coexist” with WIFI using the “coexistance module”. 

 

Other Applications of ESP32 

SD Card support (store and retrieve data: text, photo, audio, etc.) 

Audio support (microphone and speaker)
